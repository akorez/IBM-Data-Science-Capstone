## About

I predicted if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX
advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62
million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each,
much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
Therefore, if I can determine if the first stage will land, I can
determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an
alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
